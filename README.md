# Project: Data Modeling with Postgres
[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) Data Engineering Nanodegree Project

## Introduction
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to.
Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis.

### Our role is to:
- Create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis.

## Project Description
In this project, we applied data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python.

## Datasets & ETL pipeline
The [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/) is a freely-available collection of audio features and metadata for a million contemporary popular music tracks.

### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song.

### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above.

## Database Schema
We use a star schema to create:

- Fact Table
- Dimension Tables

### Fact Table
**songplays** - Records in log data associated with song plays.

### Dimension Tables
**users** - Users in the app.
**songs** - Songs in music database.
**artists** - Artists in music database.
**time** - Timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units.

## Example Queries

#### FIND SONGS

```
song_select = ("""SELECT songs.song_id songid, artists.artist_id artistid
                  FROM songs
                  JOIN artists ON songs.artist_id=artists.artist_id
                  WHERE songs.title=%s
                  AND artists.name=%s
                  AND songs.duration=%s
""")
```

## Results

`%sql SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 5;`

 * postgresql://student:***@127.0.0.1/sparkifydb
